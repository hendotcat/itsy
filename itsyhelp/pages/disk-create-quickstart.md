choosing "quick start" on the [create disk screen][create] takes you to the quick start screen.
here you can choose from a number of premade disks to use as a starting point.

browse through the list of starter disks and tap the one you want to try.
whichever disk will be imported to your library as a new disk.
your new disk will automatically open in the [inspect disk screen][inspect].

[create]: /disk/create
[inspect]: /disk/inspect
