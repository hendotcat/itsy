choosing "share" on the [inspect disk screen][inspect] takes you to the share disk screen.
here you can export your disk as a HTML file to share with the world.

as soon as you enter this screen, your device will prompt you to select a destination.
once you're done sharing, you'll be automatically returned to the [inspect] screen.
